## Introduction

In this section, we'll provide an overview of Android app security and the importance of securing APIs. Understanding potential vulnerabilities is crucial for building robust and secure applications.

## Security Best Practices

Here, we'll discuss the best practices for securing Android applications and APIs. We'll cover topics such as secure communication, authentication, authorization, and encryption.

## Common API Vulnerabilities

This section will cover some of the most common vulnerabilities found in APIs, including:

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- Excessive Data Exposure

We will demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can be exploited and provide recommendations on how to prevent them.

## Getting Started : Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

### Intercept HTTPS Traffic On A Android Emulator

#### Windows

Name of the tool we are going to use is [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) Download the Windows Installer.

1.  Open cmd and type ipconfil /all
2. Get your local IPv4 Address
3. Open Android Studio and run an emulator
4. Set your emulators proxy to IPV4:8080
5. Run mitmweb mit proxy client.
6. On the emulator browser go to [http://mitm.it/](http://mitm.it/) 
7. Download .cert CA Certificate for mit proxy.
8. Open device settings and under security->advanced There is a tab to install CA certificates pick the cert you downloaded/

Basic setup is done and mit proxy is ready to observe traffic on your local host [http://127.0.0.1:8081/#/flows/](http://127.0.0.1:8081/#/flows/)

Most likely on most of the applications you want to investigate you will get an error message (sslv3 alert certificate unknown)
So you need to bypass the ssl-handshake on the APK that you trying to investigate for that purpose ;

1. Create a folder on the computer
2. enter the folder in Powershell
3. and run command "npm install -g apk-mitm" (to run the command nodejs npm have to be installed.)
4. Add APK you want to investigate to the folder and rename it as x.apk
5. run command "apk-mitm x.apk" 
6. This command will automaticaly patch the apk to bypass ssl-handshakes.
7. There w'll be a file named "x-patched.apk" when its done. Uninstall the original app and install x-patched.apk to the device.
8. Run the application and you will be able to monitor HTTP Request over mitmproxy 








## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover security vulnerabilities in Android apps or APIs, responsible disclosure is crucial. This section will guide you on how to report vulnerabilities to developers and organizations in a responsible manner.
